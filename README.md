# hackathon-police-reports

A hackathon project aimed at censoring potentially racially identifying information from pdfs.

The backend django server is located in the backend directory.

The frontend React server is located in the frontend directory

To run the frontend/backend locally:
Run readme instructions in the redaction directory (including virtualenv and path setup)
run 'python manage.py runserver' in the backend/policeReports directory
run 'npm install' and 'npm start' in the frontend/hackathon-police-reports directory (frontend may take a little while to load)

When running the webapp, make sure to have popups enabled to view the edited pdf.
